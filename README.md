# UofA Gpa Calculator
A handy little tool for calculating your gpa at the UofA

## [ONLINE VERSION](https://konradstaniszewski.com/project/gpacalculator)
- Since making this script, I have also created an online version of it with a nice graphic visualization. Go check it out [HERE](https://konradstaniszewski.com/project/gpacalculator)

## How to Use:
- Go to your uofa transcript page, and tap the little go button. Then CTRL-A to select the whole page (main body section containing transcript info) and copy it into the transcript.txt file. (MAKE SURE TO REPLACE THE SAMPLE DATA ALREADY THERE). Then run gpaCalculator.py with python by doing `python3 gpaCalculator.py`.
- This will then output your GPA
